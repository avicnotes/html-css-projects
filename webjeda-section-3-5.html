        Very patient, highly professional. Cleared all my queries and set up my site for me. Would definitely recommend!

      What I liked of webjeda other than what I wrote above:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
      1) I felt assisted along each step, from the choice of the domain name to the post-edits.

        </li>
        <li>
      2) I always had a direct connection with him by WhatsApp: he always replied very fast and with great 

      accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
      3) I never felt alone: he was always ready and available to assist me anytime.
        </li>
        <li>
      4) He has a wide view of a website building, and we set up a start up strategy to promote my new website.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Very knowledgeable on technicalities. Reliable and the outcome is as required. For Websites i would suggest not to look any further than WebJeda!
